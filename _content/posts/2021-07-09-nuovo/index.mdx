The **Kerguelens** (overseas territory of **France**) are an archipelago of more than 300 islands and islets, lost down in the southern Indian Ocean along the way to the Antarctic.

It's **one of the most remote places on Earth**: Madagascar, the nearest inhabited place, is far more than 3000 km.<br/>
But they're quite interesting under many aspects indeed.

The islands are of volcanic origin and are one of the only two above sea-level portions of a much vaster (three times the size of Japan) submarine plateau originated tens of millions of years ago.
The other portion are the Heard and McDonald Islands (Australian territory), which are nothing less than 450 km further south.
